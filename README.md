ðŸŸ¢ Customer Segmentation & Behaviour Analysis (ML - KMeans)

ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project applies K-Means Clustering on customer data to segment them into meaningful groups. The dataset contains demographic, financial, and behavioral information, helping to identify:

Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education, Occupation)

Financial attributes (Income, Premium, Coverage Amount)

Behavioral patterns (Purchase history, Service interactions, Policy preferences)

Customer segmentation for better targeting

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

K-Means Clustering (unsupervised learning)

Data preprocessing (Label Encoding, Standardization)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

Applied K-Means with 4 clusters to classify customers into distinct groups

Segmentation labels created:

High Value Customers â†’ High income, high premium, strong coverage amount

Low Value Customers â†’ Low income & premium contribution

Medium Value Customers â†’ Balanced income, coverage, and premium

New/Young Customers â†’ Younger age, lower coverage, entry-level premium plans

Cluster distribution:

Cluster 3 â†’ 15,427 customers (largest segment)

Cluster 2 â†’ 13,511 customers

Cluster 1 â†’ 12,493 customers

Cluster 0 â†’ 12,072 customers

Average feature values show:

High-value clusters have significantly larger premium & coverage amounts

Low-value clusters contribute less revenue and need engagement strategies

Insights support targeted marketing, retention, and personalized policy recommendations
